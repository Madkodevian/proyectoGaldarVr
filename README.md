### General Info
***
This is an API project about a VR walk on Galdar's Technology Park.

## Technologies
***
The technologies that I used in my project are:
* Technology stack: Unity (Ver. 2021.2.2f1), Unity Hub (Ver. 2.4.5)
* ORM: Sequelize. (Ver. Node: 14.18.0, CLI: 6.3.0, ORM: 6.12.0-alpha.1])

## Installation
***
To use my project, clone the repository and then, add it in the Unity Hub (the files I deleted to upload the project, will set up in that new project).

¿What can you see in my project?
For now, you can look into three views that are VR walks.

If you click in one of these VR walks, for example in the first, you can see a 360º photo, and three objects in which you can click to interact it.
